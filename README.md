Project Goal:
To create a pokemon trainer showcase website that displays information focused around 3 pokemon chosen by the student using AJAX to retrieve said data. This project is focused on client side technologies.

Inspiration:
While the point of this project was to practice getting API data, I wanted to do more than a
simple one page Pokedex. I'm a fan of classic videogames and thought it would be fun to
design a mini-site around one of the classic Pokemon games. I picked Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire
because of it's "enhanced" graphics and colors (for the time).

I did a lot of research for this... and by "research" I mean I downloaded Pokemon Sapphire (I like blue)
and played a few hours of the game through an emulator. I took screenshots and used Photoshop to piece them
together, creating the background in FindPokemon.html.

I would've loved to make this an interactive game with a controllable avatar but 1) that's too much for
this project and 2) this is way beyond my skill level.
